I try to have fun at work with certain types of parties, for instance a Halloween Party the client wanted a <br>
edible <em>pumpkin man </em>
<img src="/Users/leighannesmith/lc101/html-me-something/img/ediablepumpkinman.jpg"/>
Making a puking pumpkin with guacamole surrounded by chips</br>
The top of the pumpkin has shrimp covered in cocktail sauce for the brains.  A red Pepper for the heart with a knife in it. </br>
Surronded by hickory smoked St Louis style Ribs nice and saucy for effect of bloody ribs<br>
Hot dogs wrapped in their buns with almonds in the top for fingers and toes.  Mini weenies and cheese sticks along the legs for <br>
extra snacks of the legs. <br>

We had themed drinks with the always popular Butterbeer and Witches Brew to quench your thrist.
